# Simple Episode Renamer
Simple script to rename files into SXXEXX format

To use simply download the script and run it with `python3 rename.py` in the directory your files are in

If you do not specify a season, episode number to start with, or directory to save it to it will default to season 1, episode 1, in a directory called "renamed".
